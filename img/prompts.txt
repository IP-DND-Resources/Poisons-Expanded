Combat Application. In a watercolor scene, a warrior crouches as he carefully coats an arrowpoint with poison from a glass vial, his intense focus accentuated by unkempt dark hair and a determined demeanor. The background is filled with a chaotic battle between an armored figure and a monstrous foe, while soft, earthy tones and loose brushstrokes lend depth and atmosphere to the composition.

Vials. A watercolor painting on paper depicts a rolled-out leather wrap holding several glass vials of different shapes and sizes. Each vial contains a liquid of a different color—blue, red, green, yellow—glowing softly. The wrap is laid on a wooden surface, with ink outlines and textured brushstrokes emphasizing its well-used, travel-worn look.

Illegal Goods. A traditional watercolor painting, possibly with ink details, shows a shady merchant in a dimly lit shop exchanging a glowing vial with a cloaked patron. The shop is cluttered with shelves of unmarked jars and scrolls, with golden light casting long shadows, giving the scene a secretive, dangerous feel.

Apothekerin. A traditional-style watercolor painting depicts a woman in herbalist or alchemist attire crouched in a dense, green forest. She wears a satchel and leather apron, carefully gathering herbs or mushrooms into a pouch. The brushstrokes are soft and earthy, with delicate detail given to the foliage and dappled light filtering through the canopy.

Blowgun. A traditional watercolor painting depicts a figure concealed behind foliage in a forested area, aiming a blowgun from a crouched position. The colors are muted greens and browns, with soft brush lines giving a sense of tension and stealth.
