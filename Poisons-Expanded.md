# Poisons Expanded
The 2024 DMG gives some cursory outlines for advanced poisons, meant to be the basis of a DM introducing it into their game. The primary goal of this homebrew is to add Herbal Poisons and build an expansion that completes this outline into a resource that maintains a straightforward and easy to digest (pun intended!) system. Herbal poisons focus more on applying conditions rather than damage, and let creature poisons in the DMG be more damage focused. The resources found here are designed to be standalone or in addition to the Poison section of the DM's Toolbox on page 90 of the 2024 DMG.

## Poison Types*
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures. Poisons come in the following four types:

### Contact
Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

### Ingested
A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half as much damage on a failed save. 

### Inhaled
Poisonous powders and gases take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body. 

### Injury
Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or similar object. The poison remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

\column

## Identifying poisons
A character can attempt to identify a substance in a container believed to be a poison. The character makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check using a Poisoner's Kit or Alchemist's Supplies. Alternatively, a character can attempt to identify an herbal poison by making a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check using an Herbalism Kit. On a successful check, the poison is identified. If the character fails the check by 5 or less, they still correctly identify if it is a type of poison (Creature or Herbal) that could be detected by the tool being used.

## Harvesting Poisons
### Creature Poisons*
A character can attempt to harvest poison from a venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapacitated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after which the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose, and no additional poison can be harvested from that creature. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature’s poison.

### Herbal Poisons
A character can attempt to harvest poisonous herbs from a location where materials may be present. The character makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check using an Herbalism or Poisoner's Kit to find a specific material. On a successful check, the character harvests 2d4 of that material. A character can attempt this check again to search for additional materials that may be present in this location, increasing the DC by 5 on each succsessive check. On a failed check, the character is unable to find any more materials in this location until that character completes a Long Rest. See the **Herbal Poison Materials** table (Items) for details.

## Crafting Poisons
Poisons are not considered magical items and can be created using standard crafting rules. 

Alternatively, 4 ounces of an herbal poison can be crafted without GP costs over the course of 1 day (8 hours of work) when the following conditions are met:
- The required Herbal Poison Materials are directly supplied.
- A glass container with at least 4 ounces of space available is supplied to contain the crafted poison.
- Proficiency with and use of an Herbalism or Poisoner's Kit. 

##### A single dose of poison is 4 ounces. ***

### Glass Containers
- 1 Vial can contain 4 ounces
- 1 Glass bottle can contain 1.5 pints (24 ounces)

#### Container Note
Most potions, oils, and similar liquid substances are contained in a 4 ounce vial. If the vial containing a substance is used but the vial is not destroyed, your DM may allow you to save the vial for reuse later.

### Herbal Poison Materials
Herbal poison materials can be harvested from certain locations and used to craft herbal poisons.

## Purchasing Poison*
In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poison easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire the poison they seek.

### Tranquilize
This poison is more of a sleep aid than anything else and could easily be considered more of a medicine. DMs should consider making this more readily available

## Conditions

- Your minimum Exhaustion level is 1

### Footnotes

- (*) This data is simply a reference to the mechanics printed in the DMG for complete evaluation of this homebrew.

- (**) The only change from the 2024 PHB is to specify "Basic Poison". This is to better clarify how this feat is intended to be used.

- (***) See "Optional Dosage Addendum" for alternate dosage and application mechanics. Currently playtesting.

## Optional Dosage Addendum
### Ambiguity
There is some ambiguity as to how "1 dose" of injury poison is used regarding weapons and ammunition. Based on how it is used, Basic Poison should be considered an injury poison. For other poison types, it seems to be clear 1 dose = 1 use.

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 90; Poison, Basic

As a Bonus Action, you can use a vial of Basic Poison to coat one weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition.
}}

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 206; Poisoner

As a Bonus Action, you can apply a [Basic] poison dose to a weapon or piece of ammunition.
}}

{{note
DMG (2024) Pg 227; Poison, Injury

Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or similar object.
}}

Interestingly, the Injury Poison entry doesn't say "1 dose" where as the Poisoner feat does.

### Inconsistency
Assuming 4 ounces of a poison is intended to be sufficient to coat 3 pieces of ammunition, then applying it to a melee weapon should apply for more than 1 hit. Implied by this, a full dose of poison shouldn't have to be applied in its entirety. The portion that would be applied to 1 arrow should be all that is required to be removed from the vial, allowing the remaining poison to retain it's potency until needed. Similar to how Rations are sold as a 2 lbs item, but a Medium creature only needs to consume 1 lbs at a time.

### Efficacy
Considering the 2024 Monster manual and Poison damage and Poisoned condition, and other comparables, here is some data.

|Type|Immune %|Resistant %|Vulnerable %|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|Poison|23%|1.8%|0%|
|Cold|4.3%|12.4%|0.8%|
|Fire|9.2%|9.6%|1.8%|
|Poisoned|23.4%|0%|0%|
|Exhaustion|15.5%|0%|0%|
|Frightened|15.5%|0%|0%|
|Charmed|18.5%|0%|0%|
|Paralyzed|11.6%|0%|0%|

Poison damage and Poisoned is already the least useful damage type and condition against creatures by a large margin.

### Weapon Application (Optional)
One dose (4 ounces) of an Injury poison contains enough uses to subject a creature to its effects up to 4 times. Once applied to a weapon or piece of ammunition, the poison retains it's potency for 1 minute. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from the poisoned weapon or ammunition is subjected to the effect of the poison applied and one applied use of the poison is expended.

As a Bonus Action, you can apply up to 4 ounces of an Injury poison from a single container you are holding to a melee weapon. Alternatively, you can apply 1 ounce of an Injury poison from a single container you are holding to a piece of ammunition or a ranged weapon with the Thrown property, up to 4 times, choosing a different weapon or piece of ammunition each time.
