# Poisons Expanded
The 2024 DMG gives some cursory outlines for advanced poisons, meant to be the basis of a DM introducing it into their game. The primary goal of this homebrew is to add Herbal Poisons and build an expansion that completes this outline into a resource that maintains a straightforward and easy to digest (pun intended!) system. Herbal poisons focus more on applying conditions rather than damage, and let creature poisons in the DMG be more damage focused. The resources found here are designed to be standalone or in addition to the Poison section of the DM's Toolbox on page 90 of the 2024 DMG.

## Poison Types
For poison types, see Appendix A - DMG

## Identifying poisons
A character can attempt to identify a substance in a container believed to be a poison. The character makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check using a Poisoner's Kit or Alchemist's Supplies. Alternatively, a character can attempt to identify an herbal poison by making a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check using an Herbalism Kit. On a successful check, the poison is identified. If the character fails the check by 5 or less, they still correctly identify if it is a type of poison (Creature or Herbal) that could be detected by the tool being used.

## Harvesting Poisons
### Creature Poisons
For harvesting creature Poisons, see Appendix A - DMG

### Herbal Poisons
A character can attempt to harvest poisonous herbs from a location where materials may be present. The character makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Nature) check using an Herbalism or Poisoner's Kit to find a specific material. On a successful check, the character harvests 2d4 of that material. A character can attempt this check again to search for additional materials that may be present in this location, increasing the DC by 5 on each succsessive check. On a failed check, the character is unable to find any more materials in this location until that character completes a Long Rest. See the **Herbal Poison Materials** table (Items) for details.

\column

## Crafting
Poisons are not considered magical items and can be created using standard crafting rules. Alternatively, a dose of an herbal poison can be crafted in 1 hour when supplying the required materials and using an Herbalism Kit to craft it. Each dose of poison requires a glass container with at least 4 ounces of space available. A single dose of poison is 4 ounces.

### Glass Containers
- 1 Vial can contain 4 ounces
- 1 Glass bottle can contain 1.5 pints (24 ounces)

#### Note
Most potions, oils, and similar liquid substances are contained in a 4 ounce vial. If the vial containing a substance is used but the vial is not destroyed, your DM may allow you to save the vial for reuse.

## Conditions
### Slow-Petrify
This condition can be removed by the Lesser Restoration and Greater Restoration spells, or one dose of Soft. While you have the Slow-Petrify condition, you experience the following effects:
- Your minimum Exhaustion level is 1
- At the end of each of your turns, make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 15. After three successful saves, this condition is removed. On each successive failed save, your minimum Exhaustion level increases by 1.
- If you end your turn with exhaustion level 3 or higher, this condition is removed and replaced with the Petrified condition for 24 hours.

## Purchasing Poison
In some settings, laws prohibit the possession and use of poison, but an illicit dealer or unscrupulous apothecary might keep a hidden stash. Characters with criminal contacts might be able to acquire poison easily. Other characters might have to make extensive inquiries and pay bribes before they acquire the poison they seek.

#### Tranquilize
This poison is more of a sleep aid than anything else and could easily be considered more of a medicine. DMs should consider making this more readily available

## Appendix A - DMG 2024
This data is simply a reference to the mechanics printed in the DMG for complete evaluation of this homebrew.
### Poison Types
Given their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are a favorite tool among assassins and evil creatures. Poisons come in the following four types:

#### Contact
Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.

#### Ingested
A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing Advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half as much damage on a failed save.

#### Inhaled
Poisonous powders and gases take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot Cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.

#### Injury
Injury poison can be applied as a Bonus Action to a weapon, a piece of ammunition, or similar object. The poison remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off. A creature that takes Piercing or Slashing damage from an object coated with the poison is exposed to its effects.

### Harvesting Creature Poisons
A character can attempt to harvest poison from a venomous creature that is dead or has the Incapacitated condition. The effort takes 1d6 minutes, after which the character makes a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) check using a Poisoner’s Kit. On a successful check, the character harvests enough poison for a single dose, and no additional poison can be harvested from that creature. On a failed check, the character is unable to extract any poison. If the character fails the check by 5 or more, the character is subjected to the creature’s poison.
